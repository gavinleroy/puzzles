# Practice 

In this eclectic repository you will find a smattering of solutions to algorithmic challenges. Be these (Advent of Code)[https://adventofcode.com] solutions or something I spontaneously decided to do that day; that code will end up here. 
This makeshift graveyard may posses hauntings of broken solutions, however, don't be afraid and simply move past them. My goal is often not readability and if you have a problem with something feel free to send a mail (here)[mailto:IWontRespond@gmail.com].

Cheers :beers:
